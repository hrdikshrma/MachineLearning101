# MachineLearning101 ü§ñ

Welcome to **MachineLearning101**! This repository is a personal compilation of Machine Learning codes implementations. It is structured to reinforce learning from first principles and help with interview preparation in Data Science and Machine Learning roles.

**NOTE:** The goal of the above codes is not to get the best results on a given dataset. The primary objective is to examine how a model is implemented. Kindly look into in-depth performance-enhancing techniques depending on your data.

## üß† What's Inside

- ‚úÖ Hands-on code implementations of fundamental ML algorithms
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step explanations with inline comments
- ‚úÖ Jupyter Notebooks + Python scripts
- ‚úÖ Interview-style questions and problem-solving

## üìö Topics to be covered

- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Principal Component Analysis
- Model Evaluation Techniques
- Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, etc.
## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
## üìå Future Plans

- Add ML project case studies
- Cover Deep Learning basics
- Add interview-specific question-answer sets
- Integrate model performance visualizations
- Real-world datasets for practical practice
